Sync your files across desktop and mobile devices with one click.

> [!WARNING]
> Backup your vault before using this plugin.

## Installation
1. Install and enable [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) plugin.
2. Add this plugin there using the link to this repository.

## Setup
1. Create a new vault and repository on GitHub and add `README.md` to avoid problems.
2. Generate a personal [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token).
3. Once the personal access token is filled in the plugin settings, you can authenticate the user.
4. Select a repository and branch.
5. Create and fill in the private encryption key. It should be the same for each vault you want to sync with a particular repository.
6. Sync your vault, remove `README.md` manually from GitHub and sync again.
7. Done!

> [!TIP]
> If you already had data from another storage, then transfer it to the new one and sync again.
> There may be problems on different devices, you need to fiddle around with it and everything will work out, the main thing is to back up all data.
